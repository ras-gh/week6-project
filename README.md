Chosen project - Make a basic shopping cart linked to some sample products

The shopping cart should display the details of the chosen products when a user clicks the 'add to cart' button for each product.
There should be a facility to delete each product from the list. Also a facility to change the name and address of the customer/user.
When the user decides to checkout, a message box displays the total cost payable.

The shopping cart displays product info and price etc. as it should. The total at the bottom is updating correctly.
However, further work is necessary - at the moment there is no facility to allow for different prices because I did not 
manage to work out a way of accessing the price which was grouped with other data inside a dynamically generated paragraph
The problem was that I did not know how to get the price data from the parent element which was dynamically created.
For that reason I could not update the grand total at the bottom of the cart unless I calculated for a price which remained the same for all items.  I also did not know how to access and modify
 the quantity figure which was dynamically created inside a parent paragraph containing other data as well.
 I will probably continue working on this project to improve it further.
